;;; This code is adapted from Ring (http://github.com/mmcgrana/ring).
;;;
;;; Required changes from Ring:
;;;   1. Remove dependencies which use Java classes blacklisted in App Engine.
;;;   2. Include raw cookie data retrieved using the servlet API. This does not
;;;      preclude using Ring's cookie middleware, but is required separately:
;;;      App Engine services do not always use standard-compliant cookies which
;;;      the Ring middleware parses correctly.
